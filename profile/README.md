# What is Panoptilog?

Panoptilog is a portmanteau of [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon)
and [log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)). It was inspired
by DARPA's [lifelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog) project.

The allusions to surveillance tools are somewhat tongue-in-cheek. My intentions
with this project are to enable myself to automatically journal and analyze
data on my own life. However, I want to acknowledge that the software I'm
building ultimately do amount to surveillance tools, albeit for
self-surveillance. A journal isn't spyware if one is introspecting, but an
automated journal -- wherein one is *externally observed* -- can be construed
as such even if the person observed has sole control over that data. Thus, I
named the project as I did lest I get too comfortable with that idea.

At present, we leave behind a digital trail every time we open an
internet-connected device. This personal data is not intrinsically valuable;
rather, its sensitivity lies in the fact that knowledge of someone is power
over that person. Private companies are interested in leveraging this digital
trail to manipulate our purchasing decisions. Governments are interested in it
to get a tighter hold over their citizens.

What if we retained such a log on ourselves? A near-complete record of our own
digital trail: one that can be indexed and searched **privately** for our own
personal discovery and enrichment. If leaving a digital footprint is
inevitable, then we should at least have equal access to that level of insight
into our own lives.
