# What is Panoptilog?

Panoptilog is a portmanteau of [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon)
and [log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)). It was inspired
by DARPA's [lifelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_LifeLog) project.

The allusions to surveillance tools are somewhat tongue-in-cheek. The real
intention of this project is to enable myself to automatically journal and
analyze data on my own life. However, I must acknowledge that these tools
are ultimately still a form of spyware, albeit spyware where I'm in control of
my own data. A journal isn't spyware if I am writing to it manually, but an
automated journal -- wherein I am *observed* -- can be considered spyware even
if I have sole control over that data. Thus, I named this project as I did
lest I get *too* comfortable with that idea.

At present, we leave a digital trail every time we open a device. Many
companies use the data trail we leave to further enrich themselves by learning
and exploiting our personal preferences.

What if we retained such a log on ourselves? A complete record of our own
digital trail: one that can be indexed and searched **privately**. There will
always be some privacy sacrifice from using online services, but why should
that be one-sided? If leaving a digital footprint is inevidible, then we
should at least have equal access to that level of insight into our own lives.
